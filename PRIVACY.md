# Privacy Policy for QR Scanner

**Last Updated: October 31, 2025**

## Introduction

QR Scanner ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application handles your information.

## Information Collection and Use

### Information We DO NOT Collect

QR Scanner is designed with privacy as a core principle. We want to be clear about what we **do not** do:

- ❌ We do not collect any personal information
- ❌ We do not track your scanning activity
- ❌ We do not store QR code content on our servers
- ❌ We do not share any data with third parties
- ❌ We do not use analytics or tracking services
- ❌ We do not display advertisements
- ❌ We do not require account creation or login

### Data Processing

All QR code scanning and processing happens **locally on your device**. When you scan a QR code:

1. The camera captures the image
2. The QR code is decoded on your device
3. The content is displayed to you
4. No data leaves your device

### Permissions Required

The app requires certain permissions to function:

#### Camera Permission (Required)
- **Purpose**: To scan QR codes
- **Usage**: Only active when you're actively scanning
- **Storage**: Images are processed in memory and not saved

#### Calendar Permission (Optional)
- **Purpose**: To add events from QR codes to your calendar
- **Usage**: Only when you choose to save an event
- **Storage**: Events are saved to your device's calendar app

#### Contacts Permission (Optional)
- **Purpose**: To save contact information from QR codes
- **Usage**: Only when you choose to save a contact
- **Storage**: Contacts are saved to your device's contacts app

#### Location Permission (Optional)
- **Purpose**: To display maps for location QR codes
- **Usage**: Only when viewing location-based QR codes
- **Storage**: No location data is stored or transmitted

### Local Storage

The app may store the following data **locally on your device only**:

- App preferences and settings
- Scan history (if enabled in settings)
- User interface preferences (theme, language, etc.)

This data:
- Never leaves your device
- Can be deleted by clearing app data or uninstalling the app
- Is not accessible to us or any third parties

## Third-Party Services

### Google Maps (Optional)

When you scan a location QR code and choose to view it on a map, the app uses Google Maps:

- Google Maps has its own privacy policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy
- Location data is sent to Google Maps only when you choose to view a map
- We do not receive or store any data from this interaction

### External Links

When you scan a URL QR code and choose to open it, you will be directed to an external website or app. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of external sites.

## Data Security

Since we don't collect or transmit your data, there's minimal security risk. However, we implement security best practices:

- All processing happens locally on your device
- No network connections for QR code processing
- No data transmission to external servers
- Secure handling of sensitive QR code content (passwords, WiFi credentials)

## Children's Privacy

Our app does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13. The app is safe for users of all ages.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by:

- Updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy
- Posting the new Privacy Policy in the app
- Notifying you through the app (for material changes)

## Your Rights

You have the right to:

- **Access**: View any data stored locally on your device through the app settings
- **Delete**: Clear all app data through device settings or by uninstalling the app
- **Control**: Manage permissions through your device settings
- **Opt-out**: Disable optional features like scan history

## Data Retention

Since we don't collect data, there's nothing to retain on our end. Any data stored locally on your device:

- Remains on your device until you delete it
- Is automatically deleted when you uninstall the app
- Can be cleared through app settings

## International Users

The app works entirely offline and locally. No data crosses borders because no data is transmitted.

## Contact Us

If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us:

- **Email**: [your-email@example.com]
- **Website**: [your-website.com]
- **Support**: [your-support-url.com]

## Transparency Commitment

We believe in complete transparency:

- ✅ No data collection
- ✅ No tracking
- ✅ No ads
- ✅ No third-party sharing
- ✅ Open about permissions
- ✅ Local processing only

## Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)

For users in the European Union, our legal basis for processing is:

- **Consent**: You provide explicit consent when granting permissions
- **Legitimate Interest**: Processing QR codes locally to provide the service

Since we don't collect personal data, most GDPR requirements don't apply, but we're committed to the principles of data protection.

## California Privacy Rights (CCPA)

For California residents:

- We do not sell personal information
- We do not collect personal information
- You have the right to know what data we collect (none)
- You have the right to delete data (clear app data on your device)

## Summary

**In Plain English:**

QR Scanner is a privacy-focused app that:
- Works completely offline
- Doesn't collect any of your data
- Doesn't track you
- Doesn't share anything with anyone
- Processes everything on your device

Your privacy is not just protected—it's guaranteed by design.
